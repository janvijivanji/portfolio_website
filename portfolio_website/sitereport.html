          <h3>Development Experience</h3>
          <p>This portfolio website represents my journey in learning and applying 
          web development principles. Throughout the development process, I gained 
          valuable insights into HTML structure, CSS styling, responsive design, and 
          user interface considerations.</p>
          
          <p>The initial planning stage involved sketching layouts for each page 
          and determining the overall structure of the site. I decided on a clean, 
          minimal design that would showcase my work while ensuring usability across 
          different devices.</p>
          
          <h3>Reflective Discussion of Module Experience</h3>
          <p>Working on this portfolio has significantly expanded my understanding of 
          web development fundamentals. I've learned how to structure content using 
          semantic HTML tags, style elements using CSS properties, and implement 
          responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.</p>
          
          <p>One of the challenges I faced was implementing the mobile navigation 
          menu. After several iterations, I was able to create a hamburger menu that 
          toggles the navigation links on smaller screens, providing a better user 
          experience for mobile users.</p>
          
          <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
          <p>For the color scheme, I chose [describe your color choices] because 
          [explain reasoning]. The font selection of [your font choices] was made to 
          enhance readability while maintaining a professional appearance. I used a 
          consistent layout across pages to create a cohesive experience, with the 
          exception of the project page which utilizes a grid layout to showcase 
          work samples.</p>
          
          <h3>Technical Development</h3>
          <p>The site was built using semantic HTML5 elements for better accessibility 
          and SEO. I implemented CSS Grid for the overall page layouts and Flexbox 
          for component-level arrangements. Media queries were used to create 
          breakpoints for different device sizes, ensuring the site is fully responsive.</p>

            <p>All HTML and CSS files have been validated using the W3C Validation Service:</p>
