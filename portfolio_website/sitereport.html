          <h3>Development Experience</h3>
          <p>The creation of this portfolio website marks a critical turning point in my web development career. 
            The project demonstrates my ability to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create user-friendly, accessible, 
            and responsive web pages. The website was created with a sleek, contemporary style that prioritised usability on all platforms and minimalism. An introduction and a call-to-action button on the site direct users to my portfolio of work. The site is easy to use because each component, including "About Me," "Projects," and "Contact," is clearly defined.
          </p>
          
          <p>The implementation of a mobile-friendly navigation system was the primary obstacle.
             After a few tries, I was able to develop a hamburger menu that improves the accessibility
              of the website on mobile devices by toggling the navigation links on smaller screens. 
              To guarantee a seamless user experience across several devices, this capability was essential.</p>
          
          <h3>Reflective Discussion of Module Experience</h3>
          <p>Working on this portfolio has significantly expanded my understanding of 
          web development fundamentals. I've learned how to structure content using 
          semantic HTML tags, style elements using CSS properties, and implement 
          responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.</p>
          
           <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
          <p>For the color scheme, I chose Blue (#4a6cf7) is my primary colour, and it 
            communicates professionalism and trust. Orange (#ff4500) is used as the secondary colour
             to add contrast and a splash of colour without overpowering the viewer.
           The font selection was made to enhance readability while maintaining a professional appearance. I used a 
          consistent layout across pages to create a cohesive experience, with the 
          exception of the project page which utilises a grid layout to showcase 
          work samples.</p>
          
          <h3>Technical Development</h3>
          <p>The site was built using semantic HTML5 elements for better accessibility 
          and SEO. I implemented CSS Grid for the overall page layouts and Flexbox 
          for component-level arrangements. Media queries were used to create 
          breakpoints for different device sizes, ensuring the site is fully responsive.</p>

            <h3>Validation Reports</h3>
            <p>All HTML and CSS files have been validated using the W3C Validation Service:</p>
